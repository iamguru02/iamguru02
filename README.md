Hello 
I'm a sophomore at VIT. I'm an innovative developer who can develop new practices using the old ones. I'm pretty well in learning new technologies.I'm an educator too and have an experience of teaching students on platform like Bjyus and testbook. 
Technologies - Cpp, HTML, CSS , git, github and framework like Bootstrap. 
Currently I'm learning Mysql and practising DSA in Cpp to enhance my Logic building. 
I'm pretty much into video editing and content creation.
